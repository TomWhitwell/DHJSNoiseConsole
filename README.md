# Things that Flash and Bleep

This is a bundle of documentation for a course in DIY electronics that I ran at [Dulwich Hamlet Junior School](http://www.dulwichhamletjuniorschool.org.uk/) in May/June 2015.  
The course was 4 x 90 minute sessions for 7-11 year olds, covering electronic music, building circuits on breadboards, and soldering together a Bleep-o-Matic (a modified [Atari Punk Console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Punk_Console)). 

###Contents 

- Hardware: Eagle PCB files, lasercut outlines and a BOM for the Bleep-o-Matic  
- Documentation: Powerpoint slides and printed materials 
- Next steps: some online resources and books for anyone wanting to learn more 
- Before starting, check the Issue Log for any unresolved problems
 
###History 

- The Rev2 PCB board designs (June 2015) in this repository fix a number of small issues on the boards used for the classes.

The core circuit was created as a Sound Synthesizer (then Stepped Tone Generator) by [Forrest Mims III](http://www.forrestmims.org/) in 1980, and renamed Atari Punk Console by [Kaustic Machines](http://compiler.kaustic.net/machines/apc.html) in 2005 or 2007.
